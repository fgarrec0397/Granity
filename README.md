A [React-Three-Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) widgets based game engine build with NodeJs as back-end.

![Current State of The Project](https://i.imgur.com/umqYMA5.png)

## Basic Concept
When you create a [React-Three-Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) project it can be difficult to place your 3D objects on the scene. You don't have any visual support to help you doing that. Well, this project was originally about solving this issue, but evolved in something bigger with the time.

The base idea is to create individuals widgets (that are [React-Three-Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) components), place them wherever you want on the scene and they will interact between them without any intervention from you (a bit like [Unity](https://unity.com/)).

You can add fields on each widgets that'll be displayed in the editor that you'll be able to get the value from in your React props. 

The goal is to provide you all the tools preset for you so you can focus on what is really important, your game !!

## Key Features

* Create and place programmable widgets on the scene
* Access widgets informations
* Transform widgets on the scene
* Delete widgets
* Copy widgets
* Multiple cameras support
* Key bindings (only with keyboard for now)
* Save your scene
 
## Roadmap
The roadmap elements below are not classed in order yet.
